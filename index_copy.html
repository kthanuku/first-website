            <h2>Fray and Mend</h2>
            <p>Threads unravel, loose and thin,<br>
               Pulled by time, by wear, by sin.<br>
               Edges frayed where hands once held,<br>
               The fabric worn, the seams unspelled.</p>
            
            <p>A tear begins with silent strain,<br>
               The quiet tug of grief or rain.<br>
               Winds will pull and tempests bite,<br>
               Until what’s whole slips out of sight.</p>
            
            <p>Yet still, beneath the broken weave,<br>
               The loom remembers how to breathe.<br>
               A needle hums, a steady song,<br>
               To stitch back all that time made wrong.</p>
            
            <p>Hands rethread what once was lost,<br>
               Soft with care, though sharp the cost.<br>
               Knot by knot, the seams confess<br>
               A whispered tale of tenderness.</p>
            
            <p>For things made new still hold the scars,<br>
               Lines of gold where wounds once marred.<br>
               Fray and mend, and fray again,<br>
               Is how we love, is how we mend.</p>
            
            <p>The fabric stronger, though not the same—<br>
               From tears, we find a different name.<br>
               So let it fray, and let it mend,<br>
               For life begins where things can end.</p>

            <h2>Whispers of the Wane</h2>
            <p>The moon fades, a thinning whisper in the sky,<br>
               Waning like thought slipping away<br>
               Before you can catch it.</p>
            
            <p>It hangs, barely holding on,<br>
               Its light softer,<br>
               As if it’s giving in to night.</p>
            
            <p>The weight—a quiet farewell,<br>
               But a pulse, a moment between breaths,<br>
               Where even the stars seem to wait<br>
               For the next cycle to begin,<br>
               Making way for the darkness to bloom.</p>

            <h2>The Space Between</h2>
            <p>Home is the scent of earth after rain,<br>
               A scent that carries me through winds of change.<br>
               The hyphen stretches—a thread worn thin,<br>
               A space between, where all begins.</p>
            
            <p>Caught between clocks, I lose my pace,<br>
               Time flows differently in this in-between space.<br>
               Here, I am foreign; there, I’m apart,<br>
               Suspended in silence, neither an end or start.</p>
            
            <p>This space is tension, a thread pulled tight,<br>
               A bridge suspended between day and night.<br>
               The scent of home stirs, sharp and sweet,<br>
               A compass that falters but still guides my feet.</p>
            
            <p>Yet in this pause, I start to see<br>
               The hyphen as more than a divide for me.<br>
               It holds its own, a bridge unbound,<br>
               A place where roots and wings are found.</p>
            
            <p>I carry it forward, though it pulls me back,<br>
               A thread through time, on an endless track.<br>
               Caught between clocks, I am both and none—<br>
               A fleeting shadow, a rising sun.</p>
            
            <p>The hyphen breathes, it lets me be,<br>
               A space between that shapes all of me.<br>
               It aches, it stirs, but it will suffice—<br>
               This tireless balance, this tireless strife.</p>
